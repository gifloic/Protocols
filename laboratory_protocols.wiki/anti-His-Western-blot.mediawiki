==Introduction==
This is a method for observation of His-tagged protein, and uses a colorimetric detection method to stain the membrane.  If you will need to strip and re-probe the membrane at a later date, I recommend using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled 2° antibody for chemiluminescent detection instead of the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated 2° antibody used in this protocol.

'''Note:''' PVDF membrane is very hydrophobic and must first be "whetted" with methanol before it can interact with aqueous solution.  If the membrane dries out at any point during this protocol after the transfer, you must re-wet the membrane with methanol, then rinse with Towbin buffer, then finally rinse with TBST to remove methanol, then resume the protocol.

'''Note:''' Do not use a gel box/container that is also used for Coomassie staining. Coomassie absorbs into plastic, and it will leach back out of the plastic and stain the PVDF membrane, resulting in high background staining.

==Protocol==
'''1)''' Following PAGE, transfer the protein from the gel to the PVDF membrane.
*Use Towbin buffer during the transfer
*For a semi-dry transfer, transfer for 45 min at 0.15 A.
*For a wet transfer of Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN gels, transfer for 2 hr at 95 V.  Bio-Rad Criterion gels require a different wet-transfer apparatus that we don't currently have.
*For help setting up the transfer apparatus, consult the [http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/Bulletin_2895.pdf Bio-Rad Protein Blotting Guide].

'''2)''' Block the membrane by incubating the membrane in ≈ 50 mL of blocking solution for ≈ 1 hr at room temperature with orbital shaking
*In a pinch, you can block for shorter amounts of time (≈ 30 min should still be fine).  Caution: decreasing the blocking time can increase background staining.
*Optional alternative: block overnight at 4°C with orbital shaking

'''3)''' Rinse the membrane thoroughly with TBST to keep milk out of the 1° IgG

'''4)''' Incubate with 1° antibody: His-probe G-18 (rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz sc-804) diluted 1:1500 in TBST for ≈ 1 hour at room temperature with orbital shaking
*Add 10 μL of 1° IgG to 15 mL of TBST
*Optional alternative: incubate the membrane in 1° antibody overnight at 4°C with orbital shaking
*This antibody can be reused for ≈ 1 month, or ≈ 10 times
**Store at 4°C
**Optional: add sodium azide to 0.02% [wt/vol] as a preservative to the 1° antibody solution for long term storage and use.

'''5)''' Wash the membrane three times for ≈ 10 minutes each with ≈ 20 mL of TBST at room temperature with orbital shaking

'''6)''' Incubate with 2° antibody: alkaline phosphatase-conjugated α-rabbit IgG (Sigma A2556) diluted 1:3000 in TBST for ≈ 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking
*Add 5 μL of 2° IgG to 15 mL of TBST

'''7)''' Wash the membrane three times for ≈ 10 minutes each with ≈ 20 mL of TBST at room temperature with orbital shaking
*Increase these wash times if you end up with high background signal

'''8)''' Stain the membrane with 10 mL of BCIP/NBT (Roche 11697471001) solution at room temperature with orbital shaking
*Add 1 BCIP/NBT tablet into 10 mL of water in a 15 mL conical tube and mix by inverting.
*Prepare this solution about ≈ 5 min before use, as it should be used very fresh.

'''9)''' The bands should develop fairly quickly (30 sec to a minute or two), so make sure to watch your membrane.  When sufficient stain has been produced, halt the staining process by pouring off the BCIP/NBT solution and washing the membrane with water
*Dry the membrane after staining by placing it on a paper towel and leaving it on the bench for ≈ 30 min.  This will improve the contrast between the stain and membrane, as well as make storage easier.
*The stain is permanent on the membrane and will not fade with time if stored in the dark (inside a drawer works fine).  


==Solution Recipes==

====Towbin buffer====
25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% [vol/vol] methanol, pH 8.3

To make 1 L, add:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity
!  chemical
|-
| 100 mL || 10X Towbin buffer (see below)
|-
| 200 mL || methanol
|}
Methanol will cause the 10X Towbin buffer to precipitate if added to it directly.  To make this solution, first add ≈ 600 mL of water to the 10X Towbin buffer and mix.  Then, add the methanol, and finally ''q.s.'' to 1 L with water.


====10X Towbin buffer====

To make 1 L, add:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity
!  chemical
|-
| 30.3 g || Tris base (121.14 g/mol)
|-
| 144.1 g || glycine (75.07 g/mol)
|-
|}
''q.s.'' to 1 L with water.

The pH should be 8.1 – 8.5.  Do not adjust the pH as this will affect the conductivity of the solution and result in poor transfer.


====Tris buffered saline with tween (TBST)====
20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% [vol/vol] Tween 20

To make 1 L, add:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity
!  chemical
|-
| 100 mL || 10X TBS (see below)
|-
| 1 mL || Tween 20
|}
''q.s.'' to 1 L with water and mix thoroughly to fully dissolve the Tween 20 (stir for ≈ 10 – 15 min)


====10X Tris buffered saline (TBS)====
200 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1.50 M NaCl

To make 1 L, add:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity
!  chemical
|-
| 24.228 g || Tris base (121.14 g/mol)
|-
| 87.66 g || NaCl (58.44 g/mol)
|-
|}
adjust the pH to 7.4 with concentrated HCl

''q.s.'' to 1 L with water


====Blocking solution====
5% skim milk [wt/vol] in TBST

To make 50 mL, add:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity
!  chemical
|-
| 2.5 g || skim milk powder
|-
|}
''q.s.'' to 50 mL with TBST

The milk will require 10 – 15 min with vigorous stirring to fully go into solution, therefore I recommend preparing the blocking solution during the transfer step.

Extra blocking solution can be stored overnight at 4°C for use the following day, or at -20°C for longer term storage.
