*Fill a beaker with 800 mL water
*While rapidly stirring:
**Add 15.6g NaH2PO4
**Add 103.7g Na2HPO4
***Add this quantity in small portions otherwise the powder forms a barely soluble clump.
**Adjust the pH to 7.4
*q.s. to 1L
*I have prepared this buffer twice with variations of +/- 0.02g. 
**pH-values were 7.40 and 7.41 and no further adjustment was needed.

====1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0====

*Fill a beaker with 900 mL water
*While rapidly stirring add 121.14 g trizma-base
*Insert pH meter and continue stirring
*Adjust the pH to 8.0 using concentrated HCl
**The pH of trizma-base before adjustment is ~11
*q.s. to 1L with water

| 136.2 g || Imidazole
|-
| colspan="2"| ''q.s.'' to 1 L with water

*Weigh 136.2 g imidazole
*Dissolve in 900 mL water
*Adjust the pH to 8.0
**You need concentrated HCl for this concentration of imidazole
*q.s. to 1L

*Weigh 116.9 g NaCl
*Dissolve in 900 mL water while stirring
*q.s. to 1L


====0.5 M EDTA====

|-
| 186.1 g || disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate.2H2O
|-
| 18.5 g || NaOH pellets
|-
| colspan="2"| ''q.s.'' to 1 L with water
|-
|}
*Take 800 mL water and stir vigorously
*Weigh 186.1g of disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate.2H2O and add to the solution
**This will be a white suspension
*Insert pH-meter
*Weigh 18.5g NaOH pellets and add to the suspension; wait until dissolved
*Continuously adjust the pH to 8 by adding drops of a concentrated NaOH-solution
**I usually overshoot the pH to 8.05, because the pH will drop when EDTA dissolves
**Wait until solution is clear
**If needed, adjust to pH 8
*q.s. to 1L
*Optional: Filter over a 0.22um filter

|}
*Filter sterilize, aliquot 1 mL into sterile microcentrifuge tubes, and store at -20°C
*Do not autoclave DTT or solutions containing it


====1 M Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)====
1 M in H<sub>2</sub>O

To make 50 mL, add:

|-
| 11.915 g || Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (FW = 238.30 g/mol)
|-
| colspan="2"| ''q.s.'' to 50 mL with water
|-

*Filter sterilize, aliquot 1 mL into sterile microcentrifuge tubes, and store at -20°C
*IPTG will take ≈ 10 – 20 min to fully dissolve into solution, so make sure the solution is homogenous prior to filtration.
