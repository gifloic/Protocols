==Introduction==
Bradford assay is used to determine the concentration in your protein solution. This protocol is optimized for speed and ease of use, at the sacrifice of some accuracy.  A protocol designed to obtain a maximally accurate measurement is available from [http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/LIT33.pdf bio-rad].  If you require a precise measurement of the [protein], I recommend using the [https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/Q33211 qubit] instead.


==Assay==
# Add 980 μL of [[#1× Bradford reagent|1× Bradford reagent]] to a 1.5 mL cuvette
# Add 20 μL of sample protein to cuvette
#* don't forget to prepare a blank sample by combining 20 μL buffer with 980 μL of the 1× Bradford reagent
# Cap cuvette with a small piece of parafilm and invert ~8-10 times to mix
# Incubate at room temp for 5 min
# Measure the light absorbance at 595 nm
#* [protein] = 1.031 × A<sub>595</sub> ﹣ 0.033
#* this assay has a linear range of 0.2 ~ 1.2 mg/mL.
