===Ampicillin===
100 mg/mL in H<sub>2</sub>O

To make 50 mL, add:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity
!  chemical
|-
| 5 g || Ampicillin sodium salt (FW = 371.39 g/mol)
|-
| colspan="2"| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_satis ''q.s.''] to 50 mL with water and filter sterilize.
|-
|}
*Aliquot 1 mL into sterile microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20°C
*Use ampicillin at a minimum of 50 μg/mL in ''Escherichia coli'' cultures.  I will often use ampicillin at 100 μg/mL, and 150 μg/mL is the maximum that ''E. coli'' can generally handle.
*The presence of ampicillin in media is indicated by a single black line.
*Ampicillin is abbreviated as "AMP" 


===Carbenicillin===
50 mg/mL in H<sub>2</sub>O

| 2.5 g || Carbenicillin disodium salt (FW = 422.36 g/mol)

|-
|}
*Aliquot 1 mL into sterile microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20°C
*Carbenicillin is commonly used at 50 μg/mL in ''E. coli'' cultures.
*The presence of carbenicillin in media is indicated by two black lines.
*Carbenicillin is abbreviated as "CARB"


===Kanamycin===
25 mg/mL in H<sub>2</sub>O

To make 100 mL, add:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity
!  chemical
|-
| 2.5 g || Kanamycin sulfate (FW = 582.58 g/mol)
|-
| colspan="2"| ''q.s.'' to 100 mL with water and filter sterilize
|-
|}
*Store at 4°C (it doesn't hurt, but there's no need to store this at -20°C)
*The presence of kanamycin is indicated by a single red line.
*Kanamycin is abbreviated as "KAN"
*Kanamycin should be used at 30 μg/mL in media without added phosphate, like [[Media#Lysogeny Broth (LB)|LB]].
*Kanamycin should be used 100 μg/mL in media with added phosphate, like [[Media#MDA-5052|MDA-5052]]
*Kanamycin should not be used with media containing more than 50 mM phosphate, like [[Media#Terrific Broth (TB)|Terrific Broth]].


===Chloramphenicol===
34 mg/mL in ethanol

To make 50 mL, add:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity

|-
| 1.7 g || Chloramphenicol (FW = 323.13 g/mol)
|-
| colspan="2"| ''q.s.'' to 50 mL with ethanol
|-
|}
*Store in a 50 mL conical tube at -20°C
*Chloramphenicol is commonly used at 34 μg/mL in ''E. coli'' cultures
*The presence of chloramphenicol in media is indicated by a single green line
*Chloramphenicol is abbreviated as "CHLOR"


===Tetracycline===
5 mg/mL in ethanol

To make 50 mL, add:

*Store in a 50 mL conical tube at -20°C
*Tetracycline is commonly used at 12.5 μg/mL in ''E. coli'' cultures
*The presence of tetracycline in media is indicated by a single blue line
*Tetracycline is abbreviated as "TET"


Alternatively, if you have tetracycline hydrochloride, make a 10 mg/mL stock in H<sub>2</sub>O

To make 50 mL, add:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  quantity

|-
| 0.5 g || Tetracycline-HCl (FW = 480.90  g/mol)

*Aliquot 1 mL into sterile microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20°C
*Tetracycline-HCl is commonly used at 11.5 μg/mL in ''E. coli'' cultures
*The abbreviation and color indicator are the same for tetracycline and tetracycline-HCl
